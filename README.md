# AIR-QUALITY-INDEX-DASHBOARD


🌫️ Air Quality Index Dashboard
This repository contains an interactive Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard developed using real-time or historical government data. It tracks and visualizes air pollution metrics to support environmental awareness and help users make informed decisions based on AQI trends and health implications.

📌 Project Overview
Project Title: Air Quality Index Dashboard
Domain: Environmental Data Analytics
Objective: Visualize air quality metrics using a dynamic dashboard that simplifies AQI data into meaningful insights.
Tools Used: Excel (Dynamic Buttons, Charts, Dashboard), Python (Data Cleaning), Data Wrangling, Visualization Techniques.
📈 Features
📊 Interactive Dashboard with charts for PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, O₃
🌍 Region-wise AQI and Emergency Visit Comparison (e.g., East Harlem vs. Bayside)
🗓️ Monthly & Seasonal Trends Visualization (e.g., spikes in winter, cleaner summers)
⚙️ Filter-based analysis with slicers for pollutant type, year, season, and area
🧠 Health Data Correlation (Asthma-related emergencies by location and pollutant)
🔍 Insight-driven formatting to identify danger zones and alerts
🔧 Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Excel	Data cleaning, dashboard design, visualization
Python (Pandas)	Preprocessing & filtering data before Excel use
Charts & Pivot Tables	Line, Bar, Pie, Treemap charts; data summarization
Slicers & Conditional Formatting	Dynamic filtering, highlighting risk zones
📂 Files Included
File Name	Description
AIRQUALITYDASHBOARDFINAL.xlsx	Final version of the AQI dashboard with pivot tables, slicers, and visual insights

📊 Key Analysis & Insights
Pollution Hotspots: East & Central Harlem show highest asthma emergencies
Safe Zones Identified: Areas like Bayside and Upper East Side have significantly fewer incidents
Seasonal Effects: Notable AQI spikes during winter; cleaner air in spring/summer
Pollutant Ranking: NO₂ is the highest contributor followed by PM2.5 and O₃
Health Impact: Direct correlation between emergency visits and pollutant levels (Ozone, NO₂, PM2.5)
AQI Distribution: Most records fall under ‘Good’ (47.14%) and ‘Moderate’ (27.86%), with fewer ‘Unhealthy’ entries
🚀 How to Use
Download and open the .xlsx file in Microsoft Excel.
Navigate through dashboard tabs to explore AQI metrics, seasonal patterns, and emergency hotspots.
Use filters to explore data by:
Pollutant Type
Date/Season
Region
Interpret data via visualizations: pie charts, bar graphs, treemaps, stacked bars, and more.
